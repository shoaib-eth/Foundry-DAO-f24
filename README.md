# DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

## What is a DAO?

`A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)` is a blockchain-based organization run collectively by its members, without centralized leadership. Decisions within a DAO are made through transparent voting, using smart contracts to enforce rules and automate processes. Members typically participate by holding governance tokens, which grant voting rights to influence proposals, fund allocation, and organizational policies.

## What we are going to do?
1. We are going to have a contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every transaction that the DAO wants to send has to be voted on
3. We will use ERC20 tokens for voting
